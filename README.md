# React TypeScript

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Installing

```
yarn
```
Or using NPM
```
npm install
```

#### Development
We will utilise `webpack-dev-server` to run a dev server. It serves webpack projects and updates the browser automatically with any changes we make in our code.

You can run `webpack-dev-server --mode development` or alternatively utilise our npm scripts inside our `package.json` 

```
yarn dev
```
Or using NPM
```
npm run dev
```


#### Production
You can run `webpack --mode production` or the below using our npm scripts.
```
yarn build
```
Or using NPM
```
npm run build
```



## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - App bundler for JavaScript.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript Testing Framework.

#### Required for Webpack and TypeScript
* [Awesome Typescript Loader](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader) - Helps Webpack compile our TypeScript code using `tsconfig.json`

#### Webpack Plugins
* [HTML Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) - Simplifies creation of HTML files to serve our webpack bundles.
